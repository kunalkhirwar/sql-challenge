**Instructions**
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

**Data Modeling**
Inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, used QuickDBD.

**Data Engineering**
Used the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Made sure to do the following:
-- to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
-- for the primary keys, verified that the column is unique. Otherwise, created a composite key, which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
-- made sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

**Data Analysis**
--List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
--List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
--List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
--List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
--List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
--List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
--List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
--List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
